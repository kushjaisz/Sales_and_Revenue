Sales and Revenue App


## Description

This application is based on the MVVM pattern used, the One Activity strategy with navigation using fragments, On launch, you have to enter your name and your organisation name, which saves the data in shared preferences. After that, the next fragment asks a few questions related to animals. You can also ask about milk rates, which are also saved in shared preferences. After you fill out all these details, you will go to the sales page, where you can add your sales. After adding one sale, you can show that entry in the dashboard. (Data will be saved in Room DB.) There is an option to change the rate of milk in the setting fragment, and you can see your sales daily, weekly, monthly, as well as yearly, and there are average sales and revenue.

(I have attached a video that will help you better understand.)
